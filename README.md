Wrap element for the background and html ot top of it - parent should rotate
    rotate to 30px 60px... depending on section

use singleton for game that can be played by two+ separate players

logic for winning section randomization - 5 random 3 same 2 same not one after another

Should rotate to specific point when secton is winner??
Rotate should be done with css?? or web anim api??
